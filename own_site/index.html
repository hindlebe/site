        <div class="item" id="table-one">A black hole is called a black hole because of it’s color, especially since light can’t escape. What we can see, though, is the effects of a black hole. Analyzing the surrounding area of a black hole, we can see its effects upon its environment. For example, a star that’s close enough to a black hole can be seen being ripped apart.</div>
        <div class="item" id="table-two">But, don’t be alarmed, Earth isn’t in danger! The major black hole that astronomists believe to be within our Milky Way is light years away from Earth.</div>
        <div class="item" id="table-three">Cygnus X-1 was the first black hole discovered in the 1960’s, and it’s 10 times more massive than the Sun.</div>
        <div class="item" id="table-four">V4647 Sagitarii was thought to be 1,600 light-years away, but is further away than expected. Scientists now believe that this black hole is about 20,000 light years away.</div>
        <div class="item" id="table-five">We don’t know if this event exists, since we don’t know too much about physics, but that also means that anything may be possible</div>
        <div class="item" id="table-six">Black holes are safe to observe from a lengthy distance, but not if you get too close, which also means that it’s unlikely for a black hole to consume an entire universe.</div>
